# 1. About The Project
The project is about an imaginary retail giant called AtliQ Mart.

AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. <br>Through this exercise the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period. <br>
