# 1. About The Project
The project is about an imaginary retail giant called AtliQ Mart.

AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. <br>Through this exercise the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period. <br>

# 5. Analysis and Insights

## 5.1 Recommened Insights

### 5.1.1 Store Performance Analysis:<br>
**1. Which are the top 10 stores in terms of Incremental Revenue(IR) generated from the promotions?**<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/top10store_incrementalrevenue.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 350px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
The best stores are in Bengaluru, Chennai, and Mysuru. In Bengaluru, 4 out of 10 stores are in the top 10. Chennai also has 4 out of its 8 stores in the top 10. Mysuru has 2 out of its 4 stores in the top 10.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

*******************************************

**2. Which are the bottom 10 store when it comes to Incremental Sold Units (ISU)?**<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/bottom10stores_isu.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 350px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
All three stores from Mangalore are among the bottom 10 for Incremental Sold Units (ISU). Similarly, both stores from Trivandrum are also in the bottom 10. Additionally, two out of four stores from Visakhapatnam are also in the bottom 10 for ISU.
<br><br><br><br><br>

*******************************************

**3. How does the performance of stores vary by city? Are there any common characteristics among the top-performing stores that could be leverages across other stores?**<br>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/citywise.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 600px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;"><br>
Stores located in Tier 1 cities like Bengaluru and Chennai exhibit superior performance. Additionally, there's a notable correlation between the number of stores and revenue generation, suggesting that a higher store count contributes to increased revenue. Furthermore, selling a greater quantity of products also positively impacts revenue generation.
<br><br><br><br>

*******************************************

### 5.1.2 Promotion Type Analysis:<br>
*******************************************

**1. What are the top 2 promotion types that resulted in the highest Incremental Revenue?**<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/promotype_top2.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
The top promotion types that resulted in the highest incremental revenue are "500 Cashback" and "BOGOF" (Buy One Get One Free). This is due to their effectiveness in incentivizing purchases. "500 Cashback" offers a direct monetary benefit to customers, encouraging them to make purchases to avail the cashback. On the other hand, "BOGOF" offers customers the perception of getting more value for their money, driving increased sales volume by providing an additional product for free with a purchase.
<br><br><br>

*******************************************

**2. What are the bottom 2 promotion types in terms of their impact on Incremental Sold Units?**<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/bottom2_promotype.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
"25% off" and "50% off" promotion types are among the least effective in terms of driving incremental sold units. These promotions may be less effective in driving incremental sales due to their reliance solely on price reduction, potentially leading to perceptions of lower product value. 
<br><br><br><br>

*******************************************

**3. Is there any significance difference in the performance of discount -based promotions versus BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) or cashback promotions?**<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/isu_vs_ir.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
500 Cashback and BOGOF promotions have outperformed discount-based offers, likely due to their perceived value addition beyond mere price reduction. By providing tangible benefits like cash returns or free items, these promotions effectively incentivize purchases and attract customers, thereby driving sales and enhancing revenue.
<br><br><br><br>

*******************************************

**4. Which promotions strike the best balance between Incremental Sold Units and maintaining healthy margins?**<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/isu_vs_ir.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
500 cashback promotion strikes the best balance between Incremental Sold Units and maintaining healthy margins. It offers a direct monetary benefit to customers, incentivizing purchases without requiring them to buy multiple items or wait for a discount. This immediate cashback appeal can attract more customers and lead to higher sales volume while still maintaining healthy profit margins.
<br><br><br><br>

*******************************************

### 5.1.3 Product and Category Analysis:<br>
*******************************************

**1. Which product categories saw the most significant lift in sales from the promotions?**<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/sales_lift_cat.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
The home appliance, combo 1, and home care categories experienced the most significant increase in sales as a result of the promotions. 
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

*******************************************

**2. Are there specific products that respond exceptionally well or poorly to promotions?**<br>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/products_ha_prr.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 500px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;"><br><br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/products_combo_prr.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 500px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;"><br><br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/products_pc_prr.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 500px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;"><br><br>
Yes, certain products respond exceptionally well or poorly to promotions. For example, products like the waterproof immersion rod, high glo 15w LED bulb, and home essentials 8-product combo performed exceptionally well during the promotions. On the other hand, products belonging to the personal care category did not perform that well. This indicates that the effectiveness of promotions can vary significantly depending on the product category and the specific products being promoted.
<br><br><br>

*******************************************

**3. What is the correlation between product categoy and promotion type effectiveness?**<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAVI-CHANDRIKA-05/CODEBASICS_CHALLENGE9/main/images/prod_cate_effectivenss.JPG" alt="Image" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;">
Certain product categories, such as home appliances, home care, grocery, and staples, performed well in BOGOF promotions, indicating that this promotion type was effective in driving sales within these categories. Conversely, personal care products did not perform well, even with a 25% discount offer. 
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

*******************************************
